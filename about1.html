India is very rich in natural and cultural landscapes for tourism. The beautiful beaches, wildlife, national parks, sanctuaries, snow cover, rivers, mountain peaks, technological parks, and centres of pilgrimage are some of the tourist attractions in India. Heritage trains, yoga, meditation, Ayurveda, Siddha and natural health resorts also attract tourists in great numbers.

        The beauty of the cultural heritage and natural sites makes India a tourist paradise. We respect our guests and treat them as God. That is why we developed a cultural tradition where ‘Atithi Devo Bhava’ (Guest is God). India is the centre of spiritualism. The spiritual destinations are attracting a huge number of domestic and international tourists to India.

        Benefits of Tourism
        In the era of globalisation, travel and tourism activities have increased significantly. Promoting tourism not only creates jobs, drives exports, and generates prosperity across the world but also leads to several intangible benefits. It acts as a cultural adhesive that can be wielded as a powerful tool for global peace and integrity. It also helps people of far-flung areas to promote their culture and norms and provides the opportunity for a country to showcase various facets of its natural and cultural heritage across the world. Tourism also creates incentives for the conservation and preservation of the natural and cultural heritage of countries. They can help meet the cost of the conservation of archaeological and historic sites and prevent the deterioration or disappearance of these sites.
        
        Tourism activities are considered to be one of the major sources of economic growth. It can be regarded as a mechanism for generating employment as well as income in both formal and informal sectors. The speedy growth of tourism causes an increase in household incomes and government revenues. Central and State Governments are taking a number of initiatives to promote tourism in India.</b></p>
